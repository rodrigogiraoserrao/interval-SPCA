# Interval-SPCA

## Symbolic Formulation for Principal Component Analysis of Interval-Valued Data

This repository holds the code that implements a fully symbolic formulation of Principal Component Analysis for interval-valued data.
This is a product of my MSc thesis.
The code, as submitted for my MSc thesis, can be found in the [`thesis`](https://github.com/RojerGS/interval-SPCA/tree/thesis) branch of this repository.


## Code

 - `spca.R` contains the implementation of the SPCA method.
 - `sym.R` contains helper functions related to the symbolic nature of the SPCA method.
 - `utils.R` contains miscellaneous utilities.
